a software system for managing a fleet of future spacecraft is being built. Initially, classes representing the team members and different types of spacecraft will be constructed using interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance. Then, objects of these classes will be created, followed by generating various reports displaying different information about the spacecraft fleet, such as total maintenance cost, overall firepower of the fleet's spacecraft, and more.
